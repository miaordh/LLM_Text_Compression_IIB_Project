SINGAPORE – Prime Minister Lawrence Wong has removed Workers’ Party chief Pritam Singh as Leader of the Opposition (LO), and asked the opposition party to nominate another MP to fill the position. 
In a statement on Jan 15, PM Wong said: “Having considered the matter carefully, I have decided that Mr Singh’s criminal convictions, taken together with Parliament’s considered view of his unsuitability, make it no longer tenable for him to continue as the LO.”
Mr Singh’s designation as the LO ceased with immediate effect.
PM Wong said his decision was necessary to uphold the rule of law, as well as the dignity and integrity of Parliament. 
This means that Mr Singh will no longer be given the privileges of the position, which include the right of first reply during parliamentary debates, more time for his speeches and twice the allowance of an elected MP.
The move came a day after the House on Jan 14 approved a motion raised by Leader of the House Indranee Rajah. It said Mr Singh’s conduct and court conviction in relation to former WP MP Raeesah Khan’s lie in Parliament in 2021 meant that he had fallen short of the requirements and standards expected of an LO.
All PAP MPs and Nominated MPs agreed to the motion, while the 11 WP MPs present in the House dissented.
